the poison belongs to the ballroom,
the trophy belongs to the gallery,
the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
and the knife belongs to the dining room.
And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.

Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.

* 2. sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
